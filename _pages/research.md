Currently, my work focuses on radiation damage effects in materials. I use various materials characterization techniques, including DSC, Raman spectroscopy, and SAXS/WAXS to analyze polymer samples exposed to extreme environments. I am also interested in statistical tests and uncertainty quantification for my end application of nuclear safeguards. For an explanation of how my data might eventually be used for materials accounting purposes, feel free to reach out over email!

My previous computational experience includes Raman spectrum prediction in group III nitrides with DFT (QuantumEspresso) under Dr. Greg Walker and on mechanical predictions in metal-ligand bonds with MD (NAMD) with Prof. Markus Buehler and Dr. Eesha Khare. I also assisted the design firm Design Earth with their 2021 Venice Biennale project, "The Planet After Geoengineering" and worked with Prof. Ariel White on various projects related to voter behavior and policing.

I worked as a technical writer for the NJ firm Maestro Technologies, Inc., for which I developed user-facing content, produced marketing and publicity materials, and was a major contributor to grant proposals.
