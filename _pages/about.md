I work with [Prof. Michael Short](https://pripyat.mit.edu/) in the Mesoscale Nuclear Materials lab, where my work focuses on radiation damage in polymers. My thesis assesses low dose Î±-irradiation effects in fluorinated polymers, with potential applications to historic materials control and accounting. Previously, I graduated with my SB in Chemical Engineering and my SB in Literature from MIT, advised by Prof. Greg Rutledge and by Prof. Noel Jackson.

You can read more about my research interests and projects on the Research tab, and my resume/CV are available in English and French. I can be reached by email via avng at mit dot edu.
